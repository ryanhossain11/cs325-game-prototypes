<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<li>I'm reiterating my third assignment game, which is a mini game that's able to be played when entering the Game classroom. I added different stages where the difficulty gets increasingly harder where the number of books that spawn increase after each stage. I also added powerups which, when obtained, give you an extra life point and make a sound effect.
