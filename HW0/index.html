<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
I'm going to be honest this game isn't very original beside that artwork.
I couldn't let my imagination run and code that game at the same time.
It would've taken a long time. But I did learn a lot from this first game allowing me to be able to do a lot more next.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
My game technology is interesting because the car stays in between the street but follows where the car goes.
The Snowball also falls and the sprites when they collide cause the car to die and you lose a life.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
I learned how to use debug to figure out where the assets points are located so that I can figure out where to put cooridinates when coding.
The easisest part was adding images. Hardest part was managing keep the car in bounds and the figuring out how to make the snow ball fall in the lane.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
<li>Falling SnowBall: <a href="https://www.stickpng.com/img/miscellaneous/snowballs/snowball">Snow Ball</a></li>
<li>Snow Background: <a href="http://www.bradfitzpatrick.com/racing-game-winter-snow-night-landscape-background-enviroment-design-001/">Background</a></li>


</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
The game it most closely resembles is the original phaser bouncy game that we had as a template.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move the car left to right to avoid snowballs and dying.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is used is snowy danger to avoid dying
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
I used mouse location as input, randomness from the snowballs, genre is racing, play style is mouse drag.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
Moving to cursor and randomness. Also the physics sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
I want them to earn a high score in the game and beat other peoples highscores.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic.
Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play).
You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype.
You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.

The actions the players can perform is the moving the mouse around to drag the car. The system dynamics is the fact that the snowball kills you if you touch it. So you have 3 lives to try and avoid this from happenin to you.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
To move the mouse quickly and be aware constantly of the snowballs falling moving left or right quickly.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
The world the game is set in is a snowy mountain. You are trying to escape as snow keep falling and you dont want to die. The character is just the car driver and the car is a special snow mobile.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
The general gamers ages 4-100, this isn't set to a certain age group or audience. Anyone who wants to play can.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
The game can take as little as 3 seconds or unlimited time. Because the game doesn't end until you die it can take forever.
