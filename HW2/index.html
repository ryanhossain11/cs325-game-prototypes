</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<li>Having the ability to stop cars and let other cars proceed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>Making the sprites and background wasn't that hard, but controlling and spawning what cars at what times, along with stopping them on click were the hardest.</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Made it all myself</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<li>Your job is to control the traffic flow of the police cars, and not let them crash each other, whom are trying to get to their police investigation.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<li>The input I used for this game is having the ability to control cars by clicking on them, when you click on them this will stop the car.
	The randomness is the time at which the police cars come.
</li>


<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<li>Your job is to not let the police cars crash into each other. You can do this by stopping specific police cars to in order to give way to other police cars.
	In order to stop the car, you must click on it and to let it drive again, just click on it again. Anytime cars crash into each other, you lose. Try to survive as long as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<li>Figure out which two cars you need to stop when four cars are aproaching the intersection
</li>


<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<li>I'm trying to reach traffic lights since they must figure out how to control traffic with police cars.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
