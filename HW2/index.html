<h2>Do Chickens Really Cross the Road</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<li>Controlling chickens with more than one coming at the intersection
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<li>Having the ability to chickens and let other proceed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<li>Making the sprites and background wasn't that hard, but controlling and spawning what cars at what times, along with stopping them on click were the hardest.</li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Made it all myself except for the chicken </li>
<li>Chicken: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/all-quiet-on-the-chicken-front">Chicken</a></li>

</ul>
</li>


<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<li>Your job is to control the flow of chickens so they dont crash and go in different directions, the chickens are trying to cross the road.</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<li>The input I used for this game is having the ability to control chicken by clicking on them, when you click on them this will stop the chicken.
	The randomness is the time at which the chickens come.
</li>


<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<li>Your job is to not let the chickens crash into each other. You can do this by stopping specific chickens in order to give way to other chickens.
	In order to stop the chicken, you must click on it and to let it walk again, just click on it again. Anytime chickens crash into each other, you lose. Try to survive as long as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<li>Figure out which two chickens you need to stop when four chickens are aproaching the intersection
</li>


<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<li>I want to reach everyone that knows about the story of the chicken crossing the road.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<li><\Depends on how good you are</li>
</li>
